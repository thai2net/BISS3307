# React Native

## Overview
- **What is React Native?**
  - React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
  - It allows developers to create native apps for iOS and Android using a single codebase.

- **Core Features:**
  - **Cross-Platform Development:** Write once, run everywhere on both iOS and Android.
  - **Native Performance:** Uses native components to provide high performance similar to native apps.
  - **Hot Reloading:** Allows developers to see changes in real-time without recompiling the entire app.

## Key Components
- **React Native CLI:**
  - Command-line interface for creating, building, and managing React Native projects.
  - Provides tools for running and debugging the app.

- **Core Components:**
  - **View:** Container for layout and styling.
  - **Text:** Renders text elements.
  - **Image:** Displays images.
  - **ScrollView:** Container that supports scrolling.
  - **TouchableOpacity:** Responds to touch events.

- **Native Modules:**
  - Access native device features (e.g., camera, location) through built-in modules or third-party libraries.

## Development Process
- **Setup:**
  - Install Node.js and npm.
  - Set up React Native CLI using `npx react-native init ProjectName`.

- **Design:**
  - Use React components to build the user interface.
  - Style components using React Native’s built-in styling capabilities or third-party libraries like Styled Components.

- **Code:**
  - Write app logic and UI using JavaScript and React.
  - Use React hooks and context for state management and side effects.

- **Testing:**
  - Test on simulators/emulators for iOS and Android, or use physical devices.
  - Tools like Jest for unit testing and Detox for end-to-end testing.

- **Deployment:**
  - Build the app for iOS and Android using `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android`.
  - Publish to the App Store and Google Play Store following their respective submission guidelines.

## Example Application
- **Simple To-Do List App:**
  - **Features:** Add, remove, and view to-do items.
  - **Components Used:** View, Text, TextInput, Button, FlatList.
  - **State Management:** Use React’s useState and useEffect hooks.

# Native iOS and Android

## Native iOS Development
- **Overview:**
  - **Platform:** Apple iOS, running on iPhones and iPads.
  - **Primary Language:** Swift (Objective-C is also used, but Swift is preferred).
  - **Development Environment:** Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Xcode:** IDE for building, testing, and deploying iOS apps. Includes Interface Builder for designing UI.
  - **Swift:** Modern programming language designed for safety and performance. Features strong typing and optionals.
  - **UIKit:** Framework for constructing and managing the app’s user interface.
  - **SwiftUI:** Declarative framework for building UIs with Swift, introduced to simplify and accelerate UI development.

- **Development Process:**
  - **Design:** Create user interfaces with Interface Builder or programmatically using SwiftUI.
  - **Code:** Implement functionality and business logic using Swift.
  - **Testing:** Use Xcode’s simulator or physical devices to test app behavior.
  - **Deployment:** Submit apps to the Apple App Store through App Store Connect.

## Native Android Development
- **Overview:**
  - **Platform:** Google Android, running on a wide range of devices including smartphones and tablets.
  - **Primary Language:** Kotlin (Java is also widely used).
  - **Development Environment:** Android Studio, Google’s official IDE for Android development.

- **Key Components:**
  - **Android Studio:** IDE providing tools for code editing, debugging, performance tooling, and more.
  - **Kotlin:** Modern programming language for Android development, offering concise syntax and improved safety features.
  - **Android SDK:** Software Development Kit providing libraries and tools for building Android apps.
  - **Jetpack:** Set of libraries, tools, and guidance to help developers build high-quality apps more easily.

- **Development Process:**
  - **Design:** Use XML for layout files or Jetpack Compose for declarative UI design.
  - **Code:** Implement app logic using Kotlin or Java.
  - **Testing:** Use Android Emulator or physical devices for testing.
  - **Deployment:** Publish apps on Google Play Store via Google Play Console.

# Cross-Platform Development on Cloud Services

## Overview
- **What is Cross-Platform Development?**
  - Cross-platform development involves creating applications that can run on multiple operating systems (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows) from a single codebase.
  - Cloud services enhance cross-platform development by providing scalable infrastructure, data storage, and backend services.

- **Benefits of Using Cloud Services:**
  - **Scalability:** Easily scale your application to handle increased traffic and data.
  - **Reduced Infrastructure Costs:** Pay-as-you-go pricing models eliminate the need for significant upfront investment in hardware.
  - **Automatic Updates and Maintenance:** Cloud providers handle server updates and maintenance.
  - **Global Reach:** Deploy applications across multiple regions to ensure low latency and high availability.
